    <p class="text-center">Actualize CRM is a a real CRM that Actualize uses to manage its prospective applicants. The system allows users to call and text leads through the Twilio API. Additionally, I worked on features involving its UI, including an internal restructuring that transforms the app into a Single Page Application, increasing ease of use. This app was created with Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, and VueJS.</p>
